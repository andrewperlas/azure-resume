            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Hello I am Andrew, systems administrator with 9+ years of professional experience managing and troubleshooting IT infrastructures. I have worked in a Managed Service Provider (MSP) company that provided on-premise and cloud services for various small to medium sized businesses throughout Southern California. After taking my talents to Hawaii, I obtained a Top Secret security clearance and now perform sysadmin work as a contractor servicing the Navy as the customer.</p>
            <br>
            
            </p>Throughout my employment at the MSP company, the technical skills I gained and my high level of customer service resulted in completion of over 12,000 customer tickets (the most in my MSP company's history) and an overall NPS rating of 93. My expertise in Windows server administration and virtualiztion technologies (VMware, Citrix AVD) that I gained from previous experience have been essential today in my support of the Navy's IT infrastructure at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Beyond professional work, I am building personal projects to establish technical skills centered around cloud and devops. These projects will provide hands-on training with cloud infrastructure (Azure), infrastructure as code (Terraform), source control (Git), and automation (Github Actions).</p>
